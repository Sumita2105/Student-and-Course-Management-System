Developed EduTrack, a web application for course and student management using Spring Boot with Maven as the build tool. Designed a dynamic backend with MySQL, utilizing Spring Data JPA for CRUD operations, auditing, and ORM relationships with sorting and pagination for handling large data records. Implemented Spring MVC validations to ensure data integrity and secured the application using Spring Security with CSRF protection, and password hashing. Built RESTful services to facilitate data exchange with other applications, tested via Postman. Applied Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP) to separate business logic from logging functionality. Reduced boilerplate code using Lombok. Deployed the application to AWS, ensuring scalability and cloud readiness.
